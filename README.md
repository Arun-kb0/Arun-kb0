ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Arun KB, a skilled MERN Stack web developer with expertise in CSS3, HTML5,JavaScript, and Java. 
I'm passionate about building robust and user-friendly web applications.

ðŸš€ Currently, I'm working on MERN Stack projects to expand my skill set and knowledge in full-stack web development. I'm open to collaborating with other developers on exciting projects that make a positive impact.

ðŸ’¡ I'm seeking new ideas to implement in my projects and enhance user experiences. If you have any suggestions or unique concepts, I'd love to hear them.

ðŸŒ± Continuous learning is key for me, and I stay updated with the latest web development trends. My tech stack includes AWS, Firebase, Google Cloud, Tailwind css, JWT, NPM, MUI,React, Redux, Socket.io, Node.js,Python, MongoDB,Linux and Postman.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you're interested in collaborating. Let's connect and create exceptional web experiences together!

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a self-proclaimed lazy genius, but that hasn't stopped me from delivering high-quality work and pushing my boundaries as a developer.
